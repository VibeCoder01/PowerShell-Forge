# PowerShell Forge

PowerShell Forge is a Next.js application that helps you build and manage PowerShell scripts through a drag‑and‑drop interface. It was generated from the Firebase Studio starter template and provides the following features:

- **Command Browser** – browse available PowerShell commands and view their parameters.
- **Script Editors** – dedicated editors for adding, launching and removing applications.
- **Drag and Drop** – easily drag commands from the browser into an editor to construct your script.
- **Parameter Editing** – modify and validate command parameters inline.
- **Script Management** – load and save scripts or export them as `.ps1` files.
